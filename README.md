# sick-ass-clock

This is the going to be the coolest clock EVER. Like, imagine normal clocks, boring right? This is not a normal clock. This is possibly the coolest clock ever invented.

An exquisite blend of Fin-glish (Finnish/English) stylization, this clock will blow your mind.

## Why

Because time rules the world. Everyone needs time.

## How

Build a word clock that changes time every five minutes. A grid of letters will be highlighted so that the correct time displays. We will use the interval function to update the time every minute.

###Boom!

##Stretch goals
1. ~~Make the site responsive~~
2. ~~Multiple backgrounds~~ 
3. Chrome app
4. Few second page loader before clock starts
